# Charity_warehouse

## About

Try to imagine that you have some goods like old furniture, clothes or toys and you do not need them. 
First, you would not like to throw them into garbage dump, because they can be helpful for someone. 
Secondly, you do not want to put them into containers which are outside home, because you are not sure what would happen with them. 
Charity_warehouse is the application which was designed to support and manage this kind of volunteering. You have to do only 4 steps: 

1. Choose goods which you want to leave,
2. Pack them into plastic bags,
3. Choose institution which you want to support,
4. Order courier to pick up bags.
